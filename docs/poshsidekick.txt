Sharing
-------

Tired of manually sharing your Poshmark closet, one listing at a time?

With Sidekick auto-sharing feature, say goodbye to manual Poshmark sharing and hello to automated sharing and more sales.

Our sharing feature ensures your Poshmark listings are shared at the best times of the day, all without the risk of ending up in share-jail.

From self-shares and party shares to community shares and share backs, Sidekick will do it all for you 24/7.

Following
---------

Feeling unrewarded following Poshers who never engage with your closet?

Use the smart following feature in the Sidekick app and you’ll never feel like following poshers yourself.

We just need a little input from you and based on that we follow only those Poshers who might love to follow your Poshmark closet.      

Following on Poshmark is a science, and we’ve perfected the formula with the Sidekick app!

Why limit yourself to just one marketplace when you can sell on many?

With the Sidekick app crosslisting feature, you can crosslist your items on Poshmark, eBay, Depop, Mercari, Kidizen, Grailed, and Vinted.

Import up to 20 listings from one marketplace and crosslist them on any other marketplace with just a couple of taps.

Also, create listings and make changes to the existing listings before crossposting them on other marketplaces.

Tired of removing backgrounds from product images one by one?

Our bulk product image BG remover helps you clear out cluttered backgrounds in seconds, not even minutes.
It’s fast, it’s accurate, and it’ll make your product photos pop like professional studio shots!

*   Give excellent customer support whenever you need it! 

Do I have to give my Poshmark Password?

Yes, that is the only way for our service to link to your account!

Tip: if you don’t feel comfortable giving your personal password, we recommend changing it first, then completing the checkout form!    

Will Sidekick help me get more Poshmark Sales?

While it entirely depends on your closet, and the quality of your listings, Sidekick will increase the traffic to your Poshmark closet, giving you more likes and more engagement, which we all know is what you need to convert to sales!

What if I’m not happy with the service?

If your not satisfied for any reason,
you have 3 days from the start of your service to request a refund, no questions asked. If it’s within 3 days, email us your order **\# HERE.**

What is Poshmark's sharing limit?

The safest number of shares allowable per day is 5000-6000 shares. But it also depends on your closet size and age. If you go over this limit, Poshmark might Soft Ban your closet or stop you from sharing for sometime. It would be best to share in a realistic pattern to avoid your closet from being red-flagged.

Why are my listing titles being altered during the delisting process?

This is not a bug, but a feature that we are using to improve your listing visibility on Poshmark. It happens when our service delists and relists your items automatically to boost their chances of appearing in the “Just In” search filter on Poshmark. This filter is the most used by buyers and it has the stigma of the item having more a chance to sell. Sometimes, the listing titles are changed slightly to avoid copy detection by Poshmark. This does not affect your listing quality or ranking. You do not need to fix this issue, but you can manually edit your listing titles back to their original state if you prefer. In our latest patch, we are giving you the option to modify how titles are altered during the relisting process. You can find it under the “Relists” section of the settings menu.

Why is my closet soft banned and how can I fix it?

A soft ban means that your closet is temporarily blocked from sharing or following by Poshmark due to excessive activity. This can happen if you manually share or follow while using our service, or if you exceed the daily limits set by Poshmark. To fix this issue, you need to stop all manual activity on your closet and wait for the ban to be lifted. You can also log out and log back in to your Poshmark account after we refresh your closet in AP. Please do not delete and reinstall the app as this will not help.

Why are my offers being sent twice?

This is another bug that we are aware of and working to fix as soon as possible. It happens when our service sends out offers to likers automatically to increase your sales. Sometimes, the offers are duplicated and sent twice to the same liker. We apologize for the confusion and we appreciate your patience. To fix this issue, you need to cancel the duplicate offer and send a new one with a different amount.

Why is my app showing zeros and not allowing me to sign in?

This is a rare issue that can happen if there is a problem with your account verification or your phone number registration. It can also happen if there is a network error or a server outage. To fix this issue, you need to check your internet connection and make sure it is stable. You also need to verify your phone number and email address with us and with Poshmark. If you still cannot sign in, please contact our support team for further assistance.

Why is my closet registered in two servers?

This is an issue that can happen if you have multiple devices or accounts linked to our service. It can cause problems with your closet activity and performance. To fix this issue, you need to unlink any devices or accounts that you are not using from our service. You also need to refresh your closet in AP and make sure it is registered in only one server. If you still have this issue, please contact our support team for further assistance.

Testimonials
------------

Sidekick is really helping out my sales on Poshmark. I went ahead and bought a one month subscription and I have been more than able to cover the cost of my prescription and make many more sales above that. Plus I am getting tons of shares and traffic to my closet.       

Helen Pressly

I have only used Sidekick app for one month now, but so far seems to be working. Since sidekick is doing all my sharing and relisting it’s allowing me the time to focus on new listings.

Gracey Slick

I’ve been with this app since the beta testing. They’ve definitely come a long way with the features offered. This app is constantly making updates and listening to its customers for what features we want!
